# Domain policies

Domain policies assign a dedicated Content Security Policy (CSP) to a content node that has hostnames configured under **Culture and Hostnames**, typically a site root. When enabled, a domain policy overrides the default **Frontend** policy for requests routed through any of that node's hostnames; all other hostnames continue using the Frontend policy.

A policy belongs to the node, not to a single hostname. A multilingual site with one hostname per culture (`example.com/nl`, `example.com/fr`, `example.com/de`) has one policy that covers all of them, including cultures added later.

Use domain policies when specific sites require unique directives—such as dedicated analytics on a microsite or third-party embeds on a campaign page.

## Create a domain policy

1. Open the **CSP Management** section in the backoffice.
2. In the tree, open the context menu (`...`) on the **Frontend** node and select **Add Domain Policy**.
3. Select a content node. The list shows every node that has at least one hostname and no domain policy yet, with its hostnames.
4. Adjust directives in the editor (pre-filled with a copy of the Frontend policy), then click **Save**. A new domain policy is always enabled, even when the Frontend policy is disabled.

The policy is created once saved and appears as a child of the Frontend node in the tree.

Domain policies support the same settings (Report-Only, Reporting, Upgrade Insecure Requests, Sources, and Evaluator) as global policies. The editor lists the hostnames the policy applies to; click **Open content item** to navigate directly to the content node.

## Disable or re-enable a policy

Toggle the status switch under **Settings** to disable a domain policy without deleting it:

- **Disabled:** Displays as `(inactive)` in the tree. Requests fall back to the Frontend policy or emit no header, depending on [`DisabledDomainPolicyBehavior`](configuration#disableddomainpolicybehavior).
- **Enabled:** The domain policy applies to requests on every hostname of the node.

{: .warning }
A CSP does not provide an origin isolation boundary. Path-based cultures on the same origin (such as `example.com/en` and `example.com/fr`) share execution context in the browser. To isolate policies, use separate hostnames.

{: .note }
Only nodes with at least one hostname can receive a domain policy. Culture-only wildcard entries don't count, as they only set the culture and never route a request. Each node supports one policy.

{: .note }
Nested sites work as you would expect. If `example.com/docs` is assigned to a node below the `example.com` root, it is routed as its own site: it gets the policy of the docs node, or the Frontend policy if that node has none. It does not inherit the root's policy.

## Policy resolution order

The policy is resolved from the hostname Umbraco routed the request through (`PublishedRequest.Domain`) and the content node it is assigned to:

| Request context | Applied policy |
|---|---|
| Backoffice (`/umbraco`) | Backoffice policy (domain policies never apply) |
| Hostname of a node with an active domain policy | Domain policy |
| Hostname of a node with a disabled domain policy | Frontend policy, or no header ([`DisabledDomainPolicyBehavior`](configuration#disableddomainpolicybehavior)) |
| Hostname of a node without a domain policy | Frontend policy |
| Unrouted requests (static assets, custom APIs, unmatched hosts) | Frontend policy |

## Delete a policy

Open the policy, click **Delete domain policy**, and confirm. Traffic on the node's hostnames reverts to the Frontend policy immediately. Global Frontend and Backoffice policies cannot be deleted.

## Renamed hostnames, removed hostnames and deleted content

Because a policy belongs to the content node, renaming a hostname (for example `example.com` to `www.example.com`) or adding and removing cultures has no effect on it: the policy keeps applying to whatever hostnames the node has.

A policy only stops applying when its node has no hostname left, or the node is moved to the recycle bin or deleted:

- The policy is kept rather than deleted, and appears in the tree as **Node name (no hostname)**, or **Deleted content (...)** when the node itself is gone. A node in the recycle bin keeps its hostnames in Culture and Hostnames, but Umbraco doesn't route requests to it, so its policy shows as **Node name (no hostname)** too.
- Assigning a hostname to the node again, or restoring it from the recycle bin, brings the policy back into use automatically.
- If the node is permanently decommissioned, click **Delete domain policy** to remove the orphan.

## Load balancing and uSync

- **Cache invalidation:** Saving or deleting a domain policy clears the CSP cache across all load-balanced instances automatically.
- **[uSync](../integrations/usync):** Domain policies export and import alongside global definitions. They reference the content node by key, which uSync keeps the same on every environment, so hostnames can differ per environment (for example a local hostname and the production one). Import the content and its Culture and Hostnames before the policies.

## Extending

- [`CspWritingNotification`](../advanced/notification-events#cspwritingnotification) supplies the resolved policy instance. Inspect `CspDefinition.ContentKey` (the key of the content node) to distinguish domain policies from the global Frontend policy.
- [`CspDeletedNotification`](../advanced/notification-events#cspdeletednotification) fires whenever a domain policy is deleted.
