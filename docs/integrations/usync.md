# uSync Integration

[Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.uSync](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.uSync/) adds support for synchronizing CSP policies across Umbraco environments using [uSync](https://github.com/KevinJump/uSync).

Once installed, uSync automatically includes your CSP definitions in its export/import cycle — syncing CSP configurations alongside your other Umbraco settings.

## Requirements

- Umbraco 18+
- [Umbraco.Community.CSPManager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.CSPManager/) 17+
- [uSync.BackOffice](https://www.nuget.org/packages/uSync.BackOffice/) 17+

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.uSync
```

Or via the Package Manager Console:

```powershell
Install-Package Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.uSync
```

No further configuration is needed. After installation, CSP definitions appear in the uSync export/import cycle automatically.

## How It Works

The package registers a uSync serializer for `CspDefinition` objects. When uSync exports or imports settings, it includes the frontend and backoffice CSP policies. This means you can:

- Export CSP policies from one environment and import them into another via the uSync backoffice UI
- Include CSP policies in version-controlled uSync XML files
- Deploy CSP policy changes alongside code using your normal deployment pipeline

## Domain policies

[Domain policies](../features/domain-policies) sync alongside global policies. Each is exported as `CspDefinitions/domain-{contentKey}.config`, where `contentKey` is the key of the content node the policy belongs to. uSync keeps content keys the same on every environment, so a policy lines up even when the node's hostnames differ per environment. Deleting a domain policy writes a delete marker so the removal syncs on the next import.

| Import condition | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Policy does not exist on target | Created with the exported ID. |
| Target already has a policy for that content node | Existing policy is updated. |
| Content node does not exist on target, or has no hostname | Import fails with an error. Import the content and its Culture and Hostnames before importing CSP policies. |
| File reassigns an existing policy ID to a different content node | Import fails with an error. |
| Policy contains invalid values (e.g. `;`, `,`, newlines, unknown directives) | Import fails with validation errors. |

{: .note }
Domain policies belong to a content node, not to a hostname. On each environment they apply to whatever hostnames that node has in Culture and Hostnames, so local, staging and production hostnames can differ.
