# Notification Events

CSP Manager raises Umbraco notification events that allow you to extend its behaviour and integrate with your application logic.

## CspWritingNotification

Raised when the middleware is building a CSP definition for an HTTP request, before the header is written to the response. Use this to dynamically modify the CSP based on request context.

**Properties**:
- `CspDefinition` — the current CSP definition being applied (may be `null`)
- `HttpContext` — the current HTTP context

{: .note }
When a request matches a domain with a [domain policy](../features/domain-policies), `CspDefinition` represents that domain policy. Its `DomainKey` property is populated, and `IsBackOffice` is `false`. To identify frontend requests regardless of whether a domain policy applies, check `!IsBackOffice` rather than comparing `Id` to `DefaultFrontEndId`.

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Events;
using Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.Models;
using Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.Notifications;

public class CustomCspWritingHandler : INotificationHandler<CspWritingNotification>
{
    public void Handle(CspWritingNotification notification)
    {
        if (notification.CspDefinition is null) return;

        // Add an extra source when serving API requests
        if (notification.HttpContext.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/api"))
        {
            notification.CspDefinition.Sources.Add(new CspDefinitionSource
            {
                DefinitionId = notification.CspDefinition.Id,
                Source = "api.example.com",
                Directives = ["connect-src"],
            });
        }
    }
}
```

## CspSavedNotification

Raised when a CSP definition is saved through the backoffice. Use this for cache invalidation, logging, or integration with external systems.

**Properties**:
- `CspDefinition` — the saved CSP definition

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Events;
using Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.Notifications;

public class CustomCspSavedHandler : INotificationHandler<CspSavedNotification>
{
    public void Handle(CspSavedNotification notification)
    {
        var csp = notification.CspDefinition;
        // Log CSP changes
        _logger.LogInformation("CSP policy updated for {Area}",
            csp.IsBackOffice ? "BackOffice" : "Frontend");

        // Integrate with external monitoring
        // NotifySecurityTeam(csp);
    }
}
```

## CspDeletedNotification

Raised after a [domain policy](../features/domain-policies) has been deleted and the deletion committed. Global policies cannot be deleted, so this is only raised for domain policies. Moving an orphaned policy to another domain raises this for the old policy, followed by `CspSavedNotification` for the policy under its new domain and id.

**Properties**:
- `CspDefinition` — the definition as it was before deletion

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Events;
using Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.Notifications;

public class CustomCspDeletedHandler : INotificationHandler<CspDeletedNotification>
{
    public void Handle(CspDeletedNotification notification)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Domain CSP policy {Id} ({DomainKey}) deleted",
            notification.CspDefinition.Id,
            notification.CspDefinition.DomainKey);
    }
}
```

## Cache

CSP Manager caches policies and automatically clears the cache when a policy is saved or deleted — including across all servers in a load-balanced environment. No additional configuration is required.

`CspDistCacheRefresherNotification` is raised when the cache is cleared. You can handle it if you need to react to these events, but in most cases you won't need to:

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Events;
using Umbraco.Community.CSPManager.Notifications;

public class MyCacheRefreshHandler : INotificationHandler<CspDistCacheRefresherNotification>
{
    public void Handle(CspDistCacheRefresherNotification notification)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("CSP cache refreshed on this node");
    }
}
```

## Registering Handlers

Register your custom handlers using Umbraco's composer pattern:

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Composing;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.DependencyInjection;

public class MyComposer : IComposer
{
    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.AddNotificationHandler<CspWritingNotification, CustomCspWritingHandler>();
        builder.AddNotificationHandler<CspSavedNotification, CustomCspSavedHandler>();
        builder.AddNotificationHandler<CspDeletedNotification, CustomCspDeletedHandler>();
    }
}
```
